# Aran

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## ðŸ“„ Documentation

This project now includes a comprehensive documentation site built with Docusaurus, located in the `docs/website` directory. It contains:

*   **Product Information**: Overview of Aran API Sentinel and its capabilities.
*   **Feature Guides**: Detailed explanations of core features.
*   **Technical Documentation**: Initial setup guides and workflow diagrams.

**To view the documentation locally:**

1.  Navigate to the `docs/website` directory:
    ```bash
    cd docs/website
    ```
2.  Install dependencies (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (or `yarn install` if you prefer Yarn)
3.  Start the Docusaurus development server:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    (or `yarn start`)
4.  Open `http://localhost:3000` (or the port indicated by Docusaurus, usually 3000) in your browser.

(Once the documentation site is deployed, for example via GitHub Pages, the live URL will be added here.)
