## ðŸ“„ Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for Aran API Sentinel is available on our Docusaurus-powered site, located within the `docs/website` directory of this repository. This site includes:

*   **Product Information**: An overview of Aran API Sentinel, its architecture, and core value propositions.
*   **Feature Guides**: Detailed explanations of all major features. Explore guides on:
    *   AI-Powered API Discovery
    *   Configuring Threat Detection parameters
    *   Setting up Security Policies
    *   Managing Access Control (RBAC)
    *   Understanding the MCP (Mission Critical Process) Catalog
    *   And more as the platform evolves...
*   **Technical Documentation**: Setup information (primarily for platform usage), workflow diagrams illustrating key processes, and (in the future) API references for programmatic interactions.

**Accessing the Documentation:**

*   **Live Site (Once Deployed via GitHub Pages)**:
    The documentation will be available at `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/` (Note: Please replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username/organization and repository name after the first successful deployment. The exact URL might also vary if a custom domain is configured or if it's a user/organization page vs. a project page).

*   **Local Development / Viewing**:
    To view the documentation site locally:
    1.  Navigate to the Docusaurus project directory in your terminal:
        ```bash
        cd docs/website
        ```
    2.  Install the necessary dependencies (if you haven't done so already for this subdirectory):
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
        (or `yarn install` if you are using Yarn)
    3.  Start the Docusaurus development server:
        ```bash
        npm run start
        ```
        (or `yarn start`)
    4.  Open the site in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000` (Docusaurus will indicate the exact port in the terminal if 3000 is unavailable).

We encourage you to explore the documentation site for a complete understanding of Aran API Sentinel's capabilities and how to leverage them effectively.
