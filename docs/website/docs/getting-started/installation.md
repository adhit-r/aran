# Installation Guide

Aran API Sentinel is typically deployed as a centrally managed web application. Access to the platform, including user credentials and the application URL, will generally be provided by your system administrator or the team responsible for your organization's IT infrastructure.

This documentation site primarily focuses on how to use the features and functionalities of Aran API Sentinel once you have access.

## Future Topics for Installation/Deployment

As Aran API Sentinel evolves, or for specific deployment scenarios (e.g., on-premises evaluation, specific cloud environments), this section will be expanded to cover topics such as:

-   **System Requirements**: Detailed hardware and software prerequisites.
-   **Deployment Options**: Overview of different ways Aran API Sentinel can be deployed (e.g., SaaS, Kubernetes, virtual appliance).
-   **Initial Configuration Steps**: Post-deployment setup, including network configuration, integration with identity providers, and initial data source connections.
-   **Licensing**: Information on how to apply and manage licenses.

For developers contributing to the Aran API Sentinel project itself, or for those setting up a local development environment, please refer to the `README.md` file in the main source code repository for detailed setup instructions.

If you are an administrator responsible for deploying Aran API Sentinel and require assistance, please consult your support agreement or contact our deployment support team.
