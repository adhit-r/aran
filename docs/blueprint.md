# **App Name**: ARAN

## Core Features:

- Automated API Discovery: Smart API Discovery: Automatically discover and categorize APIs based on traffic and patterns using an AI-powered tool that analyzes API endpoints, request/response structures, and security protocols. Discovered APIs automatically populate a central catalog.
- API Catalog: API Catalog: Create a searchable catalog of all APIs, including documentation, ownership, and status.
- Security Policies: Security Policies: Define and enforce security policies for APIs, such as authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.
- API Dashboard: Dashboard: Provides a real-time view of API usage, performance, and security metrics.
- RBAC: Role-Based Access Control: Define roles and permissions to control access to APIs and API management functions.
- Threat Detection: Anomaly Detection: Use AI to identify unusual API traffic patterns and potential security threats; an AI tool monitors API requests, analyzes response times, and compares performance metrics against established baselines.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark electric blue (#7DF9FF) to give the feeling of digital security
- Background color: Near-black (#121212) to emphasize the digital properties.
- Accent color: Neon green (#39FF14) for highlighting security metrics
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will create a modern and objective feel for headlines or body text
- Use sharp, minimalist icons to represent different API functions and security alerts.
- Subtle animations to highlight real-time data updates and security alerts.
- Emphasize a clear, data-driven dashboard layout with visualizations for API performance and security metrics
